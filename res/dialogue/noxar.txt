[You enter the heart of Noxar’s dark fortress. Cracked stone. Moonlight through broken arches. Noxar stands still, facing away, cloak trailing.]

Noxar:
“So... you carry it.”

[He slowly turns to face you. His crimson eyes glint, but not with rage — with satisfaction.]

Noxar:
“How poetic. After decades of hunting, burning villages, chasing ghosts... the blade walks itself into my hands.”

[He begins to descend from his platform. Each step echoes.]

Noxar:
“Elaria thought she was clever. Escaping with Solthorn after I wiped out her bloodline. I nearly forgot her face—until I saw her eyes in yours.”

Noxar:
“Tell me… did she tell you what that sword truly is?”

Noxar:
“It’s not just a blade. The gem in its hilt is called Aurellight. Ancient. Divine. A shard of the sun itself, forged to imprison creatures like me.”

[He gestures, and shadows swirl around his hands.]

Noxar:
“And with it... I become more than vampire. No more hiding in ruins. No more running from dawn. With that gem, I walk under sunlight and never burn.”

Noxar:
“Immortal. Unstoppable. Eternal.”

[He spreads his arms wide, laughing softly.]

Noxar:
“So thank you, little hero. You’ve done what centuries of my loyal have failed to do.”

[He steps into a battle stance. The room pulses with energy.]

Noxar:
“Now, hand it over… or I’ll tear it from your corpse.”
